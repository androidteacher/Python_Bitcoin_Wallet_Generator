## Bitcoin Wallet Generator
To Generate a Bitcoin Wallet Address Pair Randomly Type:
```
python wallet_gen.py
```

This will create a random public/private bitcoin address by default.

To create 'not so random' wallet address pairs uncomment the line:

```
#private_key = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
```
Interesting Fact:
(The private key 0x1 has contained up to 7.8 bitcoin over the years!)
